                                    Hi. A guess, but maybe you aren't including your .css, or maybe you aren't including it after the inclusion of the bootstrap css.

                                    If that doesn't help, please post the complete html and css ... if it's large, make a small but complete html and css file that exhibits the same symptoms. Often when doing this last bit, you'll not only simplify things and allow others to more easily give you a hand, but will figure out the issue yourself; it's a good debugging technique.

                                    Oh. You can use Chrome's devtools, namely the Elements section's (I think) style and computed style sections to check for yourself. I can explain that a bit more if needed,

                                    Cheers
